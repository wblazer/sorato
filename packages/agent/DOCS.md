# @agents/agent

Core agent primitives. See `VISION.md` for strategic rationale, `ROADMAP.md` for the plan.

## Architecture

The library provides stable abstractions (traits/interfaces) and default implementations. Consumers compose them freely or supply their own via Effect Layers.

**Core primitives** (all in `src/`):

- **Sandbox** (`src/sandbox/`) — execution environment with fine-grained services: `Shell` (command execution) and `Files` (filesystem access). Tools declare dependencies on the specific services they need — `CurrentShell`, `CurrentFiles`, or both. Ships `LocalSandbox`.
- **Tool** (`src/tool/`) — `@effect/ai Toolkit` tools that delegate to sandbox services. Ships `ReadFile` + `EditFile` (hashline protocol), `Bash` (shell execution), `WriteFile` (file creation), and `Glob` (file pattern matching). Handlers use `failureMode: "return"` so errors go back to the LLM.
- **Harness** (`src/harness/`) — system prompt + tools + hooks = agent. Agent loop with multi-turn tool calling. Memory is a harness concern (hooks), not a separate primitive.
- **Session** (`src/session/`) — persistent conversation storage with tree-structured history. Messages form a tree via parent pointers (like git commits). Supports forking and branch switching. Ships `SqliteSession`.

**Evaluation primitives** live in `packages/evals/bench`: `test()`, `run()`, Reporter.

**HTTP Server** (`src/server/`) — Bun HTTP server exposing:

- `GET /handshake` — Connection validation (returns `{ version, status: 'ok' }`)
- `GET /models` — list usable models for a directory, filtered by runtime adapter support and local credentials
- Sessions API — create, list, get, delete, update session model, run agent, stop, message history
- Directories API — browse filesystem with `~` expansion
- SSE `/events` — streaming for session updates and run lifecycle

**Runtime config** — the server resolves optional defaults from `~/.config/agents/config.json(c)` and `<cwd>/.agents/config.json(c)`. It seeds `default_model` for new-session model selection and `title_model` for automatic first-message session titles without mutating existing sessions.

**Model/provider architecture** — model metadata is generated from `models.dev`, but runtime support is owned locally:

- `src/server/provider-definitions.ts` is the source of truth for which providers we support and which model ids our runtime adapters recognize
- `src/server/provider-adapters.ts` maps supported providers to Effect `LanguageModel` layers and availability checks
- `src/server/model-catalog.ts` joins generated catalog data with adapter support and environment availability to decide what the UI can actually use

**Execution model**: Three distinct contexts — orchestrator, agent runtime (harness), and sandbox. The harness runs outside the sandbox so a broken environment doesn't kill the agent loop. See `VISION.md` and `src/sandbox/DOCS.md`.

**Key design decisions**:

- Tools ARE @effect/ai `Toolkit` tools — no abstraction layer
- Everything is plain data + functions, no classes/inheritance
- Dependencies flow through Effect's `R` parameter, satisfied via Layers at the edge
- Sub-path `exports` in `package.json` for granular imports
- Sandbox is a factory (`SandboxFactory`) that returns `{ shell, files }` — fine-grained services, unified lifecycle
- Tools depend on specific services (not a monolithic session) — a tool that only reads files doesn't carry a phantom shell dependency
- IaC lives in userland — it provisions resources that satisfy `SandboxFactory` Layers
