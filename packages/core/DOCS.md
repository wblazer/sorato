# @agents/core

Core agent primitives. See `VISION.md` for strategic rationale, `ROADMAP.md` for the plan.

## Architecture

The library provides stable abstractions (traits/interfaces) and default implementations. Consumers compose them freely or supply their own via Effect Layers.

**Core primitives** (all in `src/`):

- **Sandbox** (`src/sandbox/`) — execution environment with fine-grained services: `Shell` (command execution) and `Files` (filesystem access). Tools declare dependencies on the specific services they need — `CurrentShell`, `CurrentFiles`, or both. Ships `LocalSandbox`.
- **Tool** (`src/tool/`) — `@effect/ai Toolkit` tools that delegate to sandbox services. Ships `ReadFile` + `EditFile` (depend on `CurrentFiles`) and `Bash` (depends on `CurrentShell` + `CurrentFiles`). Handlers use `failureMode: "return"` so errors go back to the LLM.
- **Harness** (`src/harness/`) — system prompt + tools + hooks = agent. Agent loop with multi-turn tool calling. Memory is a harness concern (hooks), not a separate primitive.

**Evaluation primitives** live in `@agents/bench`: `eval_()`, `run()`, Reporter.

**Execution model**: Three distinct contexts — orchestrator, agent runtime (harness), and sandbox. The harness runs outside the sandbox so a broken environment doesn't kill the agent loop. See `VISION.md` and `src/sandbox/DOCS.md`.

**Key design decisions**:

- Tools ARE @effect/ai `Toolkit` tools — no abstraction layer
- Everything is plain data + functions, no classes/inheritance
- Dependencies flow through Effect's `R` parameter, satisfied via Layers at the edge
- Sub-path `exports` in `package.json` for granular imports
- Sandbox is a factory (`SandboxFactory`) that returns `{ shell, files }` — fine-grained services, unified lifecycle
- Tools depend on specific services (not a monolithic session) — a tool that only reads files doesn't carry a phantom shell dependency
- IaC lives in userland — it provisions resources that satisfy `SandboxFactory` Layers
